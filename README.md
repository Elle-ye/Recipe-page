## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

......................................

### Continued development

Struggled a bit with the Nutrition table, because I was trying to create that table effect without actually using the table element. So that's an area that needs improvement.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5306640/how-to-set-bullet-colors-in-ul-li-html-lists-via-css-without-using-any-images-or) - This helped me learn how to make to color of a bullet point different from its text.
